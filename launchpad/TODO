Flash procedure:

Start GDB Server with `gdb_agent_console -f MSP432 xds110_msp432_jtag.dat`

Leave that running in the background.

Run `make debug` to get into the GDB and connect to the server with
`target remote localhost:55000`

Run `load` to flash the new firmware (GDB had to have been passed the binary
file to 'debug' with)

`screen /dev/ttyACM1 9600,cs8,-parenb,-cstopb,-hupcl`

TODO:

* find out if there's a less contrived way to flash the device

* would it be worth taking their debugger out of the loop and using the J-Link?

* figure out how we're going to power it, probably just want a 3.3V LDO

* set up our own Makefile with the targets we want
