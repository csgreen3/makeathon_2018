# Printed Circuit Car

The name "printed ciruit car" is a play on words with the common acronym PCB which stands for "printed circuit board".

## Explaination

The idea is to merge the electrical control board and chassis of an RC car into one! Essentially the PCB that houses the electrical components also is the base that the mechanical components (drive motors) are mounted to. Electrical components include a wireless reciever, microntroller, motor control circuitry (H-bridge), and LEDs (obviously).
